			<Text>Janibek Khan was a descendant of Genghis Khan and a co-founder and second Khan of the Kazakh Khanate from 1473 to 1480, following a successful rebellion against the Uzbek Khan Abu'l-Khayr Khan in 1465 and 1466.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Janibek's father was Barak Khan (Khan of the Golden Horde from 1422 to 1427), who was poisoned by the emirs of the former White Horde.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]He led the splinter group along with Kerei, his relative, who was also a descendant of the famous Urus Khan of the White Horde. For his wisdom, he was given the title "Az", meaning "the wise" in the Kazakh language, and so was called Az-Janibek. His son, Kasym Khan, codified the laws of his people.</Text>

			<Text>Ranavalona I survived royal court drama and out-maneuvered her rivals, and finally ascended to the throne on August 4, 1829. After positioning herself as queen following the premature death of her young husband, Radama I, Ranavalona pursued a policy of caution with regards to foreign influence and self-sufficiency, reducing economic and political ties with European powers, repelling a French attack on the coastal town of Foulpointe, and taking vigorous measures to contain the small but growing Malagasy Christian movement initiated under Radama I by members of the London Missionary Society.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]She made heavy use of the traditional practice of "fanompoana" (forced labor as tax payment) to complete public works projects and develop a standing army of Merina soldiers, whom she deployed to pacify outlying regions of the island and further expand the realm. The combination of regular warfare, disease, difficult forced labor and harsh trials by ordeal using a poisonous nut from the Tangena shrub resulted in a high mortality rate among both soldiers and civilians during her 33-year reign, with Madagascar's population reducing from 5 million in 1833 to 2.5 million in 1839.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ranavalona's European contemporaries generally condemned her policies and characterized her as a tyrant at best and insane at worst. Her traditionalist policies were abruptly reversed under the reign of her son, King Radama II.</Text>

			<Text>Robert III (The Lion of Flanders) was the Count of Nevers from 1273 and Count of Flanders from 1305 until his death. Together with his father he took part in 1270 in the Eighth Crusade, led by Saint Louis. After his return from the Crusade he continued to be a loyal aid for his father, politically and militarily, in the fight against the attempts of the French King Philip IV the Fair to add Flanders to the French crown lands.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Guy of Dampierre" broke all feudal bonds with the French king. When the resistance seemed hopeless Robert allowed himself to be taken prisoner, together with his father and his brother William of Crèvecoeur, and taken to the French King. He was locked in the castle of Chinon. He was not released until 1305.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The execution of the Peace Treaty of Athis-sur-Orge would mark the rule of Count Robert. However, in April 1310 he started to radically resist the French and with support of his subjects and his family he managed to make a stand against the French king. When Robert marched to Lille in 1319 the militia from Ghent refused to cross the Leie with him. When his grandson Louis I of Nevers pressured him as well, Robert gave up the battle and went to Paris in 1320 to restore feudal bonds with the French King.</Text>

			<Text>Karadorde Petrovic was a Serbian revolutionary who led the struggle for his country's independence from the Ottoman Empire during the First Serbian Uprising of 1804–1813. He distinguished himself during the Austro-Turkish War of 1788–1791 as a member of the Serbian Free Corps, a militia of Habsburg and Ottoman Serbs, armed and trained by the Austrians.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In early 1804, following a massacre of Serb chieftains by renegade Ottoman janissaries known as Dahis, the Serbs of the Pashalik rebelled. Karadorde was unanimously elected to lead the uprising against the Dahis at an assembly of surviving chiefs. Within six months, most of the Dahi leaders had been captured and executed by Karadorde's forces. After the final remnants of Dahi resistance had been crushed, Karadorde and his followers demanded far-reaching autonomy, which Sultan Selim interpreted as the first step towards complete independence. Selim promptly declared jihad against the rebels, but by 1806, the rebels had captured all the major towns in the Pashalik, including Belgrade and Smederevo, and expelled their Muslim inhabitants. Burdened by the demands of the Russo-Turkish War of 1806–1812, Selim offered the Serbs extensive autonomy.</Text>

			<Text>Simón Bolívar (El Libertador) was a Venezuelan military and political leader who led independence movements in South America.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Bolívar was educated abroad and lived in Spain. From 1803 to 1805, Bolívar embarked on a Grand Tour that ended in Rome, where he swore to end rule of the Spanish Empire, so when their authority in the Americas weakened due to Napoleon's Peninsular War, Bolívar became a zealous combatant and politician in the Spanish American wars of independence.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Bolívar fought as a militia officer, fighting Royalist forces for the first and second Venezuelan republics and the United Provinces of New Granada. After Spanish forces subdued New Granada in 1815, Bolívar was forced into exile on Jamaica. In Haiti, Bolívar met and befriended Haitian revolutionary leader Alexandre Pétion. After promising to abolish slavery in Spanish America, Bolívar received military support from Pétion and returned to Venezuela. He established a third republic in 1817 and then crossed the Andes to liberate New Granada in 1819. Bolívar and his allies defeated the Spanish in New Granada in 1819, Venezuela and Panama in 1821, Ecuador in 1822, Peru in 1824, and Bolivia in 1825. Venezuela, New Granada, Ecuador, and Panama were merged into the Republic of Colombia (Gran Colombia), with Bolívar as president.</Text>
